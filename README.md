A simple React application of Sudoku.

# What I learned

- Implementing different algorithms:
  - Randomly and partially fill a Sudoku grid with valid numbers to initiate a game.
  - Solve a Sudoku grid.
  - Check if the solution of a particular board is valid.
- Properly organizing React components for a same project.
- Instantiating the `constructor(props)` and `render()` methods.
